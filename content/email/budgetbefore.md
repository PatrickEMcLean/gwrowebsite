## Budget Dispute Email: BEFORE 

**Subject: Change Order Breakdowns**


Hi J-,

Below is the breakdown of charges for our change order, and for the support for the next two months. Please let me know when we can schedule some time to review this together and discuss getting some help from S- for you. As an overall statement, we have spent a LOT of time on phone calls/emails triaging through issues S- is ultimately responsible for. We recognize that this is a massive project, and that we need to be in full support, we just need to make sure we are being a little more strict with in-scope and out-of-scope changes/support.

Initial Change order
Cost: $15,000

Charge Breakdown/notes

* Lengthy and unplanned support for S- on their own code changes. Erick has spent a lot of time helping Honey triage through his own code to figure out why it doesn’t work. Several of these phone calls had no relation to us needing any code changes.

* Ecosystem Architecture changes/folder structure changes requested from B– round 1. Round 2 is still TBD.

* S- Requirements not being provided in time causing changes to all forms (provider search, contact us, fraud and abuse).

* S- Requesting a rapid change to provider search, then requesting the form to be reverted back to the original so they can have two weeks to develop to their own requirements.

* We will need to go back again in two weeks and make the form changes to what is mandated in S- requirements.

* In the S- development standards, a Windows Server 2008 platform was the requested development target. We found out two weeks ago that they are actually using a Linux platform instead. This caused us to go back and make changes to our HTML code.

 
Architecture change provided by B-
Cost: TBD, this could be done as a block of hours if B- will need more collaboration with us.
 
Charge breakdown/notes:

* Will be a separate estimate and statement of work based on requested changes, testing, and support required.

* This absolutely has to be presented to us in the next two weeks. ALL OTHER SITES WILL BE PLACED ON HOLD FOR DEVELOPMENT UNTIL THIS IS DONE AND APPLIED TO THE ECOSYSTEM.

* If this is not finished in the next two weeks, M-, R-, I-, and -, will incur a charge in addition to their initial website costs to retroactively merge these changes into their site so that every site built is on the same code base.

 
Support Retainer for Sept-Nov
Cost: $5,000 per month
 
Charge breakdown/notes

* This is an optional charge for August, but will be a required charge for our web developers to be available for ad-hoc fixes, changes, support. Right now, I have two developers working on these websites (all of them), and one is being 100% tied up on phone calls both with the group and separately for the S- developers. I cannot move forward in the current timeline without charging for that support. 




## After

**Subject: Quickly Moving Your Site to Completion**

Hi J-,

I know we've hit some unexpected bumps along the road, but after our phone call today, I feel good that we can get past them and deliver you a great site. 

As we discussed, in order to do that in a timely fashion we will need the following things. 

*1) An additional $15,000 to cover additional work due to issues with S-. I've attached a list and timeline if you need to revisit these again.*

*2) A $5,000/a month support retainer for September and November.* 
 
*3) A complete statement of the architecture changes proposed by B- in the next two weeks.*

With these three things I feel confident we can hit our December 5 launch date.

I'm very glad we can put our troubles behind us and look foward to getting this project moving again.
