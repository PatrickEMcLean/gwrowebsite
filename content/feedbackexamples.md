# Feedback Examples

The best coaches in the world give precise feedback, exactly when it is needed. This fast feedback loop is key to improvement in any skill. We provide feedback on writing in under 24 hours. In most cases, much faster. 


Depending on the nature of our engagement, we give feedback in one of three ways.

## One -- Real Time Coaching

A live session using GoogleDocs and GoogleHangouts/Skype/Phone call. We work through a document collaboratively taking full advantage of the ability of gDocs to give everyone a cursor. The effect of this method is something between telepathy and a mind-meld.

## Two -- Video Rewrites

Writing is rewriting. So, to convey the fluid process of rewriting, we use screen capture movies like this. Real-time is ideal, but this method does have the advantage of being asynchronous and low-pressure.

## Three -- Static Rewrites

There is nothing wrong with giving someone a different pass at their writing. As you can see from our [Strategic Writing Exercise](./exercise) we focus on cutting all the noise out of the signal. This can be as simple as sending a draft in an email, or as robust as a multi-column rewrite so the evolution of a document can be clearly seen.
