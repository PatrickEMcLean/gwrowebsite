## The Magic is a Shorter Feedback Loop

Imagine what the world would be like if learning to write was like learning to serve a tennis ball. You’d throw the ball into the air. You’d hit it. Then you’d have to wait two weeks to see if the ball made it over the net. 

The reason that people have difficulty writing is not that writing is hard. It's that they were the victims of a fundamentally flawed instructional method. I haven't found a single person who, with a month or two of [good feedback](./feedbackexamples) -- precise, specific feedback, provided by professional writers rather than stoned English-lit grad students -- hasn't made a great progress.

### Our Clients Include:

> There is a short list of presenters who can captivate the attention of a group of startup CEOs for two hours. Our clients write better and have improved their messaging as a result of their time spent with Patrick.&nbsp;We highly recommend gw(ro) and Patrick to anyone wishing to immediately improve their writing.

 >-- Marilyn Carpenter, Ventureprise, Inc

<br/>

 > The feedback from my team has been fantastic. Everyone appreciated the tools and tactics provided by gw(ro) and were able to implement them immediately. They’re all writing faster, shorter… and more importantly better. I’m looking forward to rolling this out to our entire agency in 2013!

>"Patrick has a knack for getting what you want to say out of your head and onto the paper in a clear, concise manner.  He frees you from using too many words and allows you to get to your point much quicker (or is it… more quickly?).  His instant feedback and critique allow for course corrections and improvements to take place right before your eyes.  At the end of the workshop, you feel better about what you have communicated, and your team knows what you want."  

>-- Lynne Ingersoll, Organization Development on the Edge (ODE) and Carolinas HealthCare System 

<br/>


>People should be required to take your class to work in marketing. Like the mandatory military service in Switzerland.

>-- Adam Roe, Lunchbox
