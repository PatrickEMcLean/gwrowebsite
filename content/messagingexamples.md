## Briefs

I think creative briefs are the most important document in the process. Get them right, get strong agreement on them and great work is easy. Get them wrong (or don't do them at all) and you're doomed from the start.

I like to keep organic and let them take a forms depending on the complexity and nature of the client. But they are always brief and enlightening, so that people can get up to speed quickly, identify the major issues and make choices.

I got a crash course in the Electronic Health Record and Medical Informatics. Not exactly fun, but it was interesting.
