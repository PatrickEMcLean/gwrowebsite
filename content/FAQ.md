### THE MOST IMPORTANT THING


<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>Because of the attention-starved time we live in, if you don’t get to the point quickly, people assume you don’t have one. Or worse, that you are trying to bullshit them.</span>

<h1 class="c2">

</h1>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>Getting started sucks. And it sucks for everybody. I wish it weren’t so. Some of these tips may help.</span>
</p>
<h2 class="c2 c15">
	<a name="h.gbt6i7reqntt"></a><span>Where to start?</span>
</h2>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>I suggest you start with the biggest, most important subject possible. With the</span><span><a class="c0" href="http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/gettysburg.htm">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c1"><a class="c0" href="http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/gettysburg.htm">Gettysburg address</a></span><span>, Lincoln didn’t start with the funeral service. He didn’t start with the War. He didn’t start with loss or how to carry on in the face of grief and depression,</span><span><a class="c0" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/10/lincolns-great-depression/304247/">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c1"><a class="c0" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/10/lincolns-great-depression/304247/">a subject with which he was intimately acquainted.</a></span><span>&nbsp;He started with the Nation. Preserving the Nation was why the war was being fought.</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>It’s hard to give specific advice without a specific piece of writing, but keep pushing to a bigger and bigger subject until you get to a beginning that excites you.</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>If you are writing a story of any kind, you start with the biggest and most interesting part. Grab ’em and don’t let go. This is often in the middle of a chronological sequence of events. (See</span><span><a class="c0" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_medias_res">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c1"><a class="c0" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_medias_res">In Media Res.)</a></span>
</p>
<h2 class="c2">
	<a name="h.qtahdax12mjl"></a><span>Write a bad version, very quickly.</span>
</h2>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>Raymond Chandler said, “The faster I write the better my output. If I’m going slow I’m in trouble. It means I’m pushing the words instead of being pulled by them.”</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>Even getting the wrong thing down on the page/screen will help you discover what the right thing could be.</span>
</p>
<h2 class="c2">
	<a name="h.p7zz1i85ijx3"></a><span>Make sure you are focused</span>
</h2>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>The world is trying to interrupt and derail you. I suggest the</span><span><a class="c0" href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c1"><a class="c0" href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro Technique</a></span><span>&nbsp;as a way to fight back. But anything you can do that will allow you to focus will make the process easier.</span>
</p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>Also recognize that you can only focus for about 30 minutes at a sitting (maybe less). As counterintuitive as it may be, taking disciplined breaks will allow you to be faster and more productive.</span>
</p>
<h2 class="c2">
	<a name="h.ozlm5v6qmi8k"></a><span>I’d like a better environment to focus on writing.</span>
</h2>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>You and me both. This pain-in-the-ass “real world” really cuts into my productivity. I’ve got good news and bad news. The bad news is that even if you were given a magic portal that let you go to the</span><span><a class="c0" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Mont_Saint-Michel_20060330.JPG">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c1"><a class="c0" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Mont_Saint-Michel_20060330.JPG">Scriptorum at the top of Mont Saint-Michel</a></span><span>&nbsp;(the most beautiful, serene places I can imagine writing) and you could still get distracted. Focus depends on you, not your surroundings. And that’s the good news. Your ability to focus is like a muscle. Working on it with something like the</span><span><a class="c0" href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c1"><a class="c0" href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro Technique</a></span><span>, will help.</span>
</p>
<h2 class="c2">
	<a name="h.9mqllno6ilc6"></a><span>Recognize that you are better at different times of the day.</span>
</h2>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>For me, mornings are the most productive. I protect them.Two good morning sessions can be as good as a week of crappy late afternoons. Whatever time that is most productive for you, schedule it and then defend it tooth and claw.</span>
</p>
<h2 class="c2">
	<a name="h.u0qrozbwxtpw"></a><span>I wish it was easier to set aside the time necessary. Perhaps I don’t understand the time it takes. Shouldn’t I be able to complete writing something very quickly?</span>
</h2>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>It depends on the</span> <span class="c3">something</span><span>&nbsp;you are writing. In general, writing can take a lot of time. What most people don’t realize is that writing doesn’t take huge hunks of time. What writing requires is small periods of focus. Most people lose productivity by trying to block out four hours to write and wasting three and half of them. Get very tough with yourself, use the pomodoro and see what you can do with just two or three sprints.</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>Also, give yourself permission to write a horrible first draft as fast as you possibly can. Try not to let your emotions lock you up.</span>
</p>
<h2 class="c2">
	<a name="h.7s0x7bnvaeue"></a><span>How do I take a topic and plan out how to write what I want?</span>
</h2>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>Any way that comfortably allows you to model the structure of what you are writing (without having to completely write it out) is good. A few suggestions:</span>
</p>
<h3 class="c2">
	<a name="h.90xlew62acfl"></a><span>Index Cards</span>
</h3>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>Jotting concepts, facts and ideas on index cards and rearranging them is a great way to help your brain form new connections and restructure things.</span>
</p>
<h3 class="c2">
	<a name="h.6zb1x7hr5ur9"></a><span>White Boards</span>
</h3>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>What’s not to love about covering a whiteboard with scribbles?</span>
</p>
<h3 class="c2">
	<a name="h.e3g3zm62vkvv"></a><span>Mind Mapping</span>
</h3>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>It’s the high-tech version of index cards. Easier for sharing and collaboration.</span>
</p>
<h3 class="c2">
	<a name="h.kxxhnok63t8r"></a><span>Free writing</span>
</h3>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>Just throw your hands at the keyboard for a while. If you can deal with the discomfort and ambiguity of free writing, structure will emerge.</span>
</p>
<h3 class="c2">
	<a name="h.trn91xowslic"></a><span>Conversation</span>
</h3>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>Take 10 minutes to talk someone through your topic. Find a person who could conceivably fit in your audience. A 10-minute conversation will give you a lot of feedback. Where do they get confused? What questions do they ask? Ask them what they want to know. Fast, easy and fun, a quick conversation can give you a wealth of information.</span>

<h2 class="c2">
	<a name="h.wn1j2lkbdhe4"></a><span>How can I be more creative?</span>
</h2>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>The question is really how do I have better ideas. This is a very broad subject. It helps to be smart. It helps to have a lot of general knowledge. But it helps even more to</span> <span class="c3">work</span><span>&nbsp;at it.</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>Accept, for a moment, that the quality of ideas you generate will follow the normal distribution of statistics. When you come up with a bunch of ideas, most of them are mediocre. A very few of them are wildly bad and a very few of them are very good. So rather than worrying about the quality of any one idea, the thing to do is to come up with a bunch of ideas and kill all the one’s that aren’t very good. Make a herd and then cull it.</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>The act of pushing through the feeling that you don’t have any more ideas causes you to deepen the understanding of the problem you are trying to solve. That in turn causes you to be more likely to come up with a better solution. A few iterations of this and you get to some good ideas.</span>
</p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>If you are working with a difficult problem, make it physical. Write your ideas on slips of paper and put them on the wall. Seems stupid, but it works. And at the very least it helps with the feeling of “I’m not getting anywhere/I don’t know what I’m doing” that accompanies every creative process.</span>

<h2 class="c2">
	<a name="h.bgvlv91l0zsi"></a><span>How do I write openers and persuasive content that will move people to action?</span>
</h2>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>You’re asking about a couple of things. But first thing is the construction of an argument. From Ancient Greece until about 1950, this was really the only kind of writing taught in school. It was called Rhetoric in the positive sense of:</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2 c7">
	<span class="c3">the art of effective or persuasive speaking or writing, esp. the use of figures of speech and other compositional techniques.</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>It is easily one of the most important skills for anyone’s career.As you might imagine, the subject of Rhetoric is huge. Here’s my stab at chopping it down to size.</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<ol class="c6 lst-kix_81aa8wi77o2e-0 start" start="1">
	<li class="c8 c2 c7">
		<span>Figure out what we all know to be true. These are your premises. Many of these are implicit. We know the sun will rise tomorrow. (For argumentation, it doesn’t really matter if we can prove a premise. It only matters that your premise is accepted by your audience as true. See also Holy War)</span>
	</li>
	<li class="c8 c2 c7">
		<span>Figure out which of your premises is the biggest, most important thing. Start there. Sometimes it helps a great deal to go two or three steps up in level – to things that should be</span> <span class="c3">stupidly</span><span>&nbsp;obvious to everyone. Like:</span>
	</li>
</ol>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<ul class="c6 lst-kix_x4570clkoyon-0 start">
	<li class="c8 c2 c12">
		<span>Companies should make money.</span>
	</li>
	<li class="c8 c2 c12">
		<span>We are a company</span>
	</li>
	<li class="c8 c2 c12">
		<span>If we don’t do A, we’re going to lose money.</span>
	</li>
	<li class="c8 c2 c12">
		<span>Therefore we should do A.</span>
	</li>
</ul>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>As an example, let’s look at the structure of two arguments that could have existed in the first Star Wars movie.</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span class="c5">Argument 1</span>
</p>
<ul class="c6 lst-kix_1c3xpmwon4k2-0 start">
	<li class="c8 c2 c7">
		<span>If we don’t do anything, the Death Star is going to blow up our planet.</span>
	</li>
	<li class="c8 c2 c7">
		<span>This will kill all of us.</span>
	</li>
	<li class="c8 c2 c7">
		<span>We should blow up the Death Star to save the planet.</span>
	</li>
</ul>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span class="c5">Argument 2</span>
</p>
<ul class="c6 lst-kix_df38fpeus8n2-0 start">
	<li class="c8 c2 c7">
		<span>If we don’t do anything, the Death Star is going to blow up our planet.</span>
	</li>
	<li class="c8 c2 c7">
		<span>This will kill all of us.</span>
	</li>
	<li class="c8 c2 c7">
		<span>We should get the hell out of here before everything goes ka-boom.</span>
	</li>
</ul>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>The difference between these two arguments is a hidden premise. These things are such a pain-in-the-ass that the Greeks had a special name for them, Enthymemes. Can you spot the hidden premise? It’s that the planet you are on is worth saving. To settle the difference between argument one and two, you have to have a third argument about whether or not the planet needs to be saved. So it is with arguments, they multiply.</span>
</p>
<h3 class="c2">
	<a name="h.6krs7tkwy3m2"></a><span>Persuasion and Argument</span>
</h3>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>An argument is only 1/3rd of what you need to persuade someone. You also need credibility(trust) and emotion. This model is known as the</span><span><a class="c0" href="http://www.occc.edu/comlab/pdf/handouts/Rhetorical.pdf">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c1"><a class="c0" href="http://www.occc.edu/comlab/pdf/handouts/Rhetorical.pdf">Rhetorical Triangle</a></span><span>.</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2">
	<span><a class="c0" href="http://www.occc.edu/comlab/pdf/handouts/Rhetorical.pdf"></a></span>
</p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>If I tell you, you should run barefoot for your health and supply no logic for this, my argument will not work. If I tell you, you should run barefoot and explain that this allows the foot to strengthen and move in ways that prevent injuries and health problems, that’s a little better.</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>But if I add, “A 10 year longitudinal study at the University of Wisconsin determined that modern running shoes</span> <span class="c3">increase</span><span>&nbsp;the incidence rate of injury among runners.” Now we’ve got all three things working in the argument’s favor.</span>

</h3>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>Most arguments don’t completely work in marketing. I think this is because they take too long. Also, because arguments tend to be too rational. I’m not really convinced that we hairless apes make decisions purely on logic. Here’s how I think it works. We make decisions with our emotions (either fear or greed) and then we run those decisions through the filter of logic to see if it checks out.</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>So what you want is an argument that is true as soon as somebody hears it. An old-time ad guy once called this “the leap from logic to magic.” Avis rent-a-car’s original campaign is a great example of this. DBB presented campaign after campaign, which Avis killed. Finally the client said, “You’re giving people reasons to use us. I want you to give people a reason to like us.”</span>
</p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>The result was the</span><span><a class="c0" href="http://sellsellblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/advertising-greatness-2-avis.html">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c1"><a class="c0" href="http://sellsellblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/advertising-greatness-2-avis.html">“We Try Harder”</a></span><span>&nbsp;campaign. The entire campaign is an argument to try Avis that is absolutely true when you hear it. One headline - “Avis needs you. You don’t need Avis. Avis never forgets this.”</span>

</h2>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>Writing is the entire process by which we figure out what we are trying to say.</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>So my unhelpful answer is, write your thoughts down.</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>My helpful answer is you write your thoughts down and work with them. Then you’ll discover that your thoughts might not have been as clear as you first imagined. Or that your words don’t quite fit what you were trying to say. Both of these are completely natural and necessary parts of the writing process.</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>There is one warning. Don’t be critical while you are trying to be creative. It will lock you up. Write a draft fast and don’t let the fact that you feel it is terrible stop you from writing more. Later, go back and read what you wrote with a critical eye.</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>Most of the time your perception of the quality of your writing will be totally unrelated to the actual quality of your writing. That which you think is terrible is often okay. And the part you think is absolutely brilliant often turns out to be crap.</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>For difficult work, the important thing is to keep your morale up and keep coming back to it. Fall down seven times. Get up eight.</span>

	<a name="h.ehwyj1c5zpqf"></a><span>How do I find the perfect “layperson” analogy to emphasize the point I am trying to make and take the prose out of the technical weeds?</span>
</h2>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>Coming up with the right analogy is the real conceptual work of writing. It can be very hard. But when you get it right, it can be very powerful. A couple of things to try.</span>
</p>
<h3 class="c2">
	<a name="h.3cmuetenzad9"></a><span>Think of a specific layperson</span>
</h3>
<p class="c2 c9"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>Imagine explaining it to your grandmother or a non-technical friend. Somebody that you have history with, so you can mine those shared experiences for the raw materials of your analogy.</span>
</p>
<h3 class="c2">
	<a name="h.wuri48uzs00d"></a><span>Come up with a lot of them</span>
</h3>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>Babe Ruth only hit a home run 8.4% of the time he was at bat. But everybody knows he set records for hitting home runs. I think even the best writers/creative people have a similar percentage for ideation. 90% of the ideas we have aren’t very good. So the only solution is to take a lot of swings.</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>If you’re really gnawing on a difficult problem, write 10 analogies. Pick the best one and try that. That might sound like a lot of work, but that’s how they do it in the big leagues.</span>

</h2>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>The way you envision your final product</span> <span class="c3">is</span><span>&nbsp;the process of getting there. Start off with an idea of what you need to convey and how you’d like to convey it. But then, allow yourself to revisit and revise your vision and goals. This is the process of writing.</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>There is a very good way to give this structure, called a Headlights Outline. If you are driving at night, you often can’t see to the end of the road – and you certainly can’t see to your destination. But it doesn’t matter. You only need to see as far as your headlights. You don’t need to figure it all out at once. Just figure out the next little bit. After you do that, figure out the next bit.</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>Don’t outline the whole thing, just outline the next part.</span>

	<span>You rewrite it. Justice Louis Brandeis said, “There is no great writing. There is only great rewriting.”</span>

	</li>
</ol>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>For example, take the question up there. It’s okay, but looking at it again I can see a way to make it a little tighter.</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2 c7"></p>
<p class="c2 c7">
	<span>How can I get my point across while being brief and to the point?</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2 c7"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>Okay, not much better, but it allows me to see what’s really going on.</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2 c7">

<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2 c7">
	<span>How can I get my point across as quickly as possible?</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>It’s iterative process. You’ll</span> <span class="c3">never</span><span>&nbsp;get to polished, crystal-clear language on the first pass. But</span> <span class="c3">anybody</span><span>&nbsp;can produce clear prose if they look at it few times. If you consistently do this with some of what you write, your first drafts will get tighter and the speed and skill with which you rewrite will increase dramatically.</span>
</p>
<h2 class="c2">
	<a name="h.2ei11cv546ig"></a><span>How do I be more concise and to the point?</span>
</h2>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>First, change the question to “How do I be more concise?”</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>Second, recognize that we say things like “concise and to the point” or “the fact that” because they lend our speech a rhythm. This rhythm gives us time to think. It gives us time to breathe. But on the screen or page, these extra words just get in the way.</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>So, the thing to do is to cut these extra things out and see if you lose any meaning. Almost all adjectives and adverbs can go. Make sure no headers or sentences repeat meaning. Make a copy of something you’ve written and just start hacking away. In a strange way, it’s kind of fun.</span>

	<a name="h.5b3h1a3q9ztq"></a><span>How do I deliver complex messages in a digestible, easy to read and entertaining fashion?</span>
</h2>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>You need a great metaphor. You also need to connect with the biggest subject possible. Why is your subject important? You could talk about packet-level security (I’m totally making that up, don’t even know if that is thing) or you talk about Trust. For example:</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2 c7">
	<span>Trust is important. Without trust no business can take place. But how can two individuals (or an individual or organization) have trust in the digital environment?</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>Then you can continue the metaphor of two people and draw analogies to various nefarious strategies. This starts to blow your subject wide open. Is there a kind of breach attempt that is like someone wearing a crappy disguise. Say, the equivalent of Groucho Marx glasses? Or a bad wig.Then you can characterize more sophisticated methods with more sophisticated disguises or cons.</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>I don’t know if my example is a good way to write about security, but you can see how a big subject and a good analogy can make your writing much more powerful.</span>
</p>
<h2 class="c2">
	<a name="h.917ovfqk0awv"></a><span>How do I write for a specific length or word count while still having great impact?</span>
</h2>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>Put the most important thing first. You can end with a rhetorical flourish, but never with an important point. That way, if somebody bails out of your copy halfway through, they still get the important information.</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>My advice is never to stretch your subject. But, if you must stretch your subject – if there is absolutely no other way around it – then you could do something like what I’ve just done. You can also give examples. For example, early in my career, I often had to stretch copy print catalogs and brochures. So I had to learn the trick of stretching out copy by using stock-in-trade phrases like “one of the best in it’s class.”</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>But no matter how skillfully you manage those tricks, I think it’s still bad writing.</span>

</h2>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>It should be all over the place. At least in the first draft. Give it another pass and make it clearer. If you are really stuck, read it out loud to somebody else. You’ll see on their face where it goes wrong. And, they will probably ask the you questions you need to ask of the piece.</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>Another way is to write each concept down on an index card and lay them all out on a big table. This helps you work with your subject without getting hung up in things like grammar, spelling, transitions, etc.</span>
</p>
<h2 class="c2">
	<a name="h.qac251c1q0v3"></a><span>What about paragraph transitions?</span>
</h2>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>The best paragraph and sentence transitions are logical. We expect the first thing we read (in a sentence or paragraph) to be the subject. Or in very, very tight relationship to the subject.</span>
</p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>For example, suppose I title a blog post “The Toughest Man I Know,” but the first sentence starts, “The thing about my Mom is…” It’s funny (or produces a little cognitive dissonance) because we have an expectation that these two things will be related.</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>Broadly speaking, we expect the object of the last sentence we read to be the subject of the next sentence we read. (or in very, very tight relation) An example will help.</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2 c7">
	<span class="c3">I had an affair. It happened about six months ago while we were on vacation. Do you remember that cute cabana boy? Yeah, it was him. When you were out playing golf. I don’t know how it happened. It just…</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2 c7">
	<span class="c3">I am so sorry. Our marriage is the most important thing to me. I’ll do anything to make this right. I have no excuse.</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>Each sentence in the first paragraph is related to the first sentence of that paragraph. And the transitions between paragraphs is logical.</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>Figuring out the structure of what you usually write will make these transitions much easier. But the only hard and fast rule is that you have to be aware of your reader’s expectation. If you make any gigantic leap, you need to re-orient them towards your subject.</span>
</p>
<h2 class="c2">
	<a name="h.6nqbp1ps4y9f"></a><span>How do I use structure as a guide for effective writing?</span>
</h2>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>The best way to figure out structure is to take a few good examples of the kind of thing you want to write and outline them. This forces you to slow down, and is, in itself, a kind of deep reading. Once you see how those pieces work, you’ll naturally combine elements to create something that works well for you.</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>It may also help to point out that there are only five basic kinds of writing.</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<ol class="c6 lst-kix_j3mu2v9ol1sg-0 start" start="1">
	<li class="c8 c2 c7">
		<span>Story</span>
	</li>
	<li class="c8 c2 c7">
		<span>Argument</span>
	</li>
	<li class="c8 c2 c7">
		<span>Instructions</span>
	</li>
	<li class="c8 c2 c7">
		<span>Dialog</span>
	</li>
	<li class="c8 c2 c7">
		<span>Summary</span>
	</li>
</ol>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>I believe these structures are atomic. Everything ever written is composed of at least one of these forms. Sure, there are other things going on inside them, but it is like the difference between the visible and the quantum weirdness.</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>For example, if I wanted to convince you that physical fitness was important, I could</span> <span class="c3">summarize</span><span>&nbsp;the risks of obesity. Then I could</span> <span class="c3">instruct</span><span>&nbsp;you to calculate your BMI and, if necessary, to seek help.</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>Or I could tell you the</span> <span class="c3">story</span><span>&nbsp;of Ralph, a guy who hasn’t gotten off the couch since he left High School. Ralph wanted to go out to get the mail. But when he tried, he had a heart attack. After a stay in the hospital, he pulled his life together and lost 150 pounds. Then I could</span> <span class="c3">argue</span><span>&nbsp;that Ralph would have been better off if he had just gone for an occasional walk. Then I could</span> <span class="c3">instruct</span><span>&nbsp;you not to be a “Ralph.”</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>These forms can be combined in almost endless ways. I could argue that you shouldn’t lie. Or I could use the story of “The Boy Who Cried Wolf,” as my argument.</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>After you understand how other writers effectively structure their writing you will find the way that is most natural and productive for you.</span>

<p class="c2">
	<span>Before I suggest a good method, I’d like to suggest that this might not be at all important. If you have a point and get to it efficiently, no-one will be much caring that your grammars or usages are a bit strange. Especially in business communications. (Did you even notice the weirdness two sentences back?)</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>Nobody cares about grammar. And they will give you a pass because your English will be a lot better than their Chinese or French or Dutch or what have you.</span>

<p class="c2">
	<span>Me too. In fact, that’s the best way. Anything very important should be proofed by a pro. But for most of the things we write. Nobody is going to notice our use of grammar as long as we have a point and get to it quickly.</span>
</p>
<p class="c9 c2"></p>
<p class="c2">
	<span>In fact, the way most people recognize bad grammar in a business setting is that they get upset when they read a piece of writing because it is wasting their time. Then they go looking for grammatical errors so they can hold them up as reasons why the writing sucks. As if wasting the reader’s time wasn’t sin enough? The point is, if you don’t waste people’s time, then they’ll probably never start shooting at your prose.</span>

# Writing FAQ

*If you don't see your question answered here, [please send it](mailto://patrickgoodwordsrightorder.com) and we'll answer it.*


### The Most Important Thing

Because of the attention-starved time we live in, if you don't get to the point quickly, people assume you don't have one. Or worse, that you are trying to bullshit them. 


### How do I Get Started? (focus and flow)

Getting started sucks. And it sucks for everybody. I wish it weren't so. A couple of things will help. 

## Write a bad version, very quickly. 

Raymond Chandler said, "The faster I write the better my output. If I'm going slow I'm in trouble. It means I'm pushing the words instead of being pulled by them."

Even getting the wrong thing down on the page/screen will help you discover what the right thing could be. 

## Make sure you are focused

The world is trying to interrupt and derail you. I suggest the [Pomodoro Technique](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/) as a way to fight back. But anything you can do that will allow you to focus will make the process easier. 

Also recognize that you can only focus for about 30 minutes at a sitting (maybe less). As counter-intuitive as it may be, taking disciplined breaks will allow you to be faster and more productive. 

## Where to start?

I suggest you start with the biggest, most important subject possible. With the [Gettysburg address](http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/gettysburg.htm), Lincoln didn't start with the funeral service. He didn't start with the War. He didn't start with loss or how to carry on in the face of grief and depression, [a subject with which he was intimately acquainted.](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/10/lincolns-great-depression/304247/) He started with the Nation. Preserving the Nation was why the war was being fought. 

It's hard to give specific advice without a specific piece of writing, but keep pushing to a bigger and bigger subject until you get to a beginning that excites you. 

If you are writing a story of any kind, you start with the biggest and most interesting part. Grab 'em and don't let go. This is often in the middle of a chronological sequence of events. See [In Media Res](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_medias_res)



## Recognize that you are better at different times of the day.  

For me, mornings are the most productive. I protect them. (Two good morning sessions can be as good as week of crappy late afternoons.) Whatever time that is most productive for you, schedule it and then defend it tooth and claw.


### How can I focus and concentrate without distractions?

I suggest the [Pomodoro Technique](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/) as a way to fight back. But anything you can do that will allow you to focus will make the process easier. 

Also recognize that you can only focus intently for about 30 minutes (maybe less). As counter-intuitive as it may be, taking disciplined breaks will allow you to be faster and more productive. 

## Shouldn't I be able to write something more quickly?

It depends on the *something* you are writing. In general, writing can take a lot of time. What most people don't realize is that writing doesn't take huge hunks of time. What writing requires is small periods of focus. Most people lose productivity by trying to block out four hours to write and wasting three and half of them. Get very tough with yourself, use the pomodoro and see what you can do with just two or three sprints. 

Also, give yourself permission to write a horrible first draft as fast as you possibly can. Try not to let your emotions lock you up. 

## How do I make a better environment in which to focus on writing? 

You and me both. This pain-in-the-ass "real world" really cuts into my productivity. I've got good news and bad news. The bad news is that you could be given a magic portal that let you go to the [Scriptorum at the top of Mont Saint-Michel](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Mont_Saint-Michel_20060330.JPG) (the most beautiful, serene places I can imagine writing) and you could still get distracted. Focus depends on you, not your surroundings. And that's the good news. Your ability to focus is like a muscle. Working on it with something like the [Pomodoro Technique](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/), will help. 



### How do I get my point across with being brief and to the point?


You rewrite it. Justice Louis Brandeis said, "There is no great writing. There is only great rewriting." 

1. Write a draft as quickly as you can. 
2. Set it down and then come back to it. 
3. Make it better by crossing things out. 

For example, take the question up there. It's okay, but looking at it again I can see a way to make it a little tighter. 

> How can I get my point across while being brief and to the point?

Okay, not much better, but it allows me to see what's really going on. 

> How can I get my point across?

But we lost something, right?

> How can I get my point across as quickly as possible?

It's iterative process. You'll *never* get to polished, crystal-clear language on the first pass. But *anybody* can produce clear prose if they look at it few times. 

If you consistently do this with some of what you write, your first drafts will get tighter and the speed and skill with which you rewrite will increase dramatically. 

## How to I take a topic and plan out how to write what I want?

Any way that comfortably allows you to model the structure of what you are writing (without having to completely write it out) is good. 

A few suggestions.

#### Index Cards

Jotting concepts, facts and ideas on index cards and rearranging them is a great way to help your brain form new connections and restructure things.

#### Mind Mapping

It's the high-tech version of index cards. Easier for sharing and collaboration.

#### Free writing

Just throw your hands at the keyboard for a while. If you can deal with the discomfort and ambiguity of free writing, structure will emerge. 

#### Conversation

Take 10 minutes to talk someone through your topic. Find a person who could conceivably fit in your audience. A 10-minute conversation will give you a lot of feedback. Where to they get confused? What questions do they ask? Ask them what they want to know. Fast, easy and fun, a quick conversation can give you a wealth of information.


### Paragraph transitions?

The best paragraph and sentences transitions are logical. We expect the first thing we read (in a sentence or paragraph) to be the subject. Or in very, very tight relationship to the subject.

For example, suppose I title a blog post "The Toughest Man I Know," but the first sentence starts, "The thing about my Mom is..." It's funny (or produces a little cognative dissonance) because we have an expectation that these two things will be related. 

Broadly speaking, we expect the object of the last sentence we read to be the subject of the next sentence we read. (or in very, very tight relation) An example will help.

> I had an affair. It happened about six months ago while we were on vacation. Do you remember that cute cabana boy? Yeah, it was him. When you were out playing golf. I don't know how it happened. It just...

> I am so sorry. Our marriage is the most important thing to me. I'll do anything to make this right. I have no excuse. 

Each sentence in the first paragraph is related to the first sentence of that paragraph. And the transitions between paragraphs is logical. 

Figuring out the structure of what you usually write will make these transitions much easier. But the only hard and fast rule is that you have to be aware of your reader's expectation. If you make any gigantic leap, you need to re-orient them towards your subject. 


### How do I write for a specific length or word count while still having great impact? 

My advice is never to stretch your subject. But, if you must stretch your subject -- if there is absolutely no other way around it -- then you could do something like what I've just done. You can also give examples. For example, early in my career, I often had to stretch copy print catalogs and brochures. So I had to learn the trick of stretching out copy by using stock-in-trade phrases like "one of the best in it's class." But no matter how skillfully you manage such tricks, I think it's still bad writing. 


## How to deliver complex messages in a digestible, easy to read and entertaining fashion?

You need a great metaphor. You also need to connect with the biggest subject possible. Why is your subject important? You could talk about packet-level security (I'm totally making that up, don't even know if that is thing) or you talk about Trust. For example

>Trust is important. Without trust no business can take place. But how can two individuals (or an individual or organization) have trust in the digital environment? 

Then you can continue the metaphor of two people and draw analogies to various nefarious strategies. This starts to blow you subject wide open. Is there a kind of breach attempt that is like someone wearing a crappy disguise. Say, the equivalent of Groucho Marx glasses? Or a bad wig. 

Then you can characterize more sophisticated methods with more sophisticated disguises or cons.

I don't know if my example is a good way to write about security, but you can see how a big subject a good analogy can make your writing much more powerful.



### What's the best way to get perfect English grammar as a non-native?

Before I suggest a good method, I'd like to suggest that this might not be at all important. If you have a point and get to it efficiently, no-one will be much caring that your grammars or usages are a bit strange. Especially in business communications. (Did you even notice the weirdness two sentences back?) 

Nobody cares about grammar. And they will give you a pass because your English will be a lot better than their Chinese or French or Dutch or what have you. 

That being said, if you really must brave the quicksands of English grammar, do it bit by bit. My suggestion is to use something like [grammarly](http://www.grammarly.com/) to give you feedback on one thing you write a day. The [Grammar Girl Podcast and Website](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/grammar-girl) are also friendly and helpful. 

You can also have a skilled friend read a couple of your emails everyday and point out an error or two.

The important thing is that there is no cramming for this. But a little bit at a time will get you a long way faster than you might think. 


## I am a non-native English speaker, but I need to write professional article in English. I would like to get an advice about that.

Use a developmental editor. Your job is to know. Their job is to shape your knowing into an article. If you are writing an article, you are an expert in something. Use another expert to help you. It's the most efficient use of everybody's time. 



### How do I distill my thoughts into words? (How do I find the right words?)


Here's how I define the process of writing:

> Writing is the entire process by which we figure out what we are trying to say.

So my unhelpful answer is, write your thoughts down. 

My helpful answer is you write your thoughts down and work with them. Then you'll discover that your thoughts might not have been as clear as you first imagined. Or that your words don't quite fit what you were trying to say. Both of these are completely natural and necessary parts of the writing process. 

There is one warning. Don't be critical while you are trying to be creative. It will lock you up. Write a draft fast and don't let the fact that you feel it is terrible stop you from writing more. Later, go back and read what you wrote with a critical eye. 

Most of the time your perception of the quality of your writing will be totally unrelated to the actual quality of your writing. That which you think is terrible is often okay. And the part you think is absolutely brilliant often turns out to be crap. 

For difficult work, the important thing is to keep your morale up and keep coming back to it. Fall down seven times. Get up eight.


### I wished my writing flowed better. I feel that I can be all over the place. Can you help?

It should be all over the place. At least in the first draft. Give it another pass and make it clearer. If you are really stuck, read it out loud to somebody else. You'll see on their face where it goes wrong. And, they will probably ask the you questions you need to ask of the piece. 

Another way is to write each concept down on an index card and lay them all out on a big table. This helps you work with your subject without getting hung up in things like grammar, spelling, transitions, etc. 


## How do I envision my final product and the process of getting there?

The way you envision your final product *is* the process of getting there. Start off with an idea of what you need to convey and how you'd like to convey it. But then, allow yourself to revisit and revise your vision and goals. This is the process of writing.

There is a very good way to give this structure, called a Headlights Outline. If you are driving at night, you often can't see to the end of the road -- and you certainly can't see to your destination. But it doesn't matter. You only need to see as far as your headlights. You don't need to figure it all out at once. Just figure out the next little bit. After you do that, figure out the next bit. That way, you'll be done with your journey in no time at all. 

### Grammar? 

Grammar is not your friend and might not even be your problem. At it's best grammar is an attempt to help writers be clear. At it's worst, grammar is a pointless fight to the death between dusty academics who are incapable of becoming productive members of society.

My blanket advice is to work to be as clear as possible. Then you will naturally write with good grammar. Especially if English is your native language.

If English is not your native language, or you are simply drawn to brave the quicksands of English grammar, do it bit by bit. My suggestion is to use something like [grammarly](http://www.grammarly.com/) to give you feedback on one thing you write a day. The [Grammar Girl Podcast and Website](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/grammar-girl) are also friendly and helpful. 


### How do I write openers and persuasive content that will move people to action.

You're asking about a couple of things. But first thing is the construction of an argument. From Ancient Greece until about 1950, this was really the only kind of writing taught in school. It was called Rhetoric in the positive sense of 

> the art of effective or persuasive speaking or writing, esp. the use of figures of speech and other compositional techniques. 

It is easily the most important skill for anyone's career. 

As you might imagine, the subject of Rhetoric is huge. Here's my stab at chopping it down to size. 

1. Figure out what we all know to be true. These are your premises. Many of these are implicit. We know the sun will rise tomorrow. (For argumentation, it doesn't really matter if we can prove a premise. It only matters that your premise is accepted by your audience as true. See also Holy War) 
2. Figure out which of your premises is the biggest, most important thing. Start there. Sometimes it helps a great deal to go two or three steps up in level -- to things that should be *stupidly* obvious to everyone. Like 

* Companies should make money. 
* We are a company
* If we don't do A, we're going to lose money.
* Therefore we should do A.

As an example, let's look at the structure of two arguments that could have existed in the first Star Wars movie. 

#### Argument 1

* If we don't do anything, the Death Star is going to blow up our planet.
* This will kill all of us. 
* We should blow up the Death Star to save the planet.

#### Argument 2

* If we don't do anything, the Death Star is going to blow up our planet.
* This will kill all of us. 
* We should get the hell out of here before everything goes ka-boom.

The difference between these two arguments is a hidden premise. These things are such a pain-in-the-ass that the Greeks had a special name for them, Enthymemes. Can you spot the hidden premise? It's that the planet you are on is worth saving. To settle the difference between argument one and two, you have to have a third argument about whether or not the planet needs to be saved. So it is with arguments, they multiply. 


## Persuasion and Argument

An argument is only 1/3rd of what you need to persuade someone. You also need credibility(trust) and emotion. This model is known as the [Rhetorical Triangle](http://www.occc.edu/comlab/pdf/handouts/Rhetorical.pdf)

If I tell you should run barefoot for your health and supply no logic for this, my argument will not work. If I tell you should run barefoot and explain that this allows the foot to strengthen and move in ways that prevent injuries and health problems, that's a little better.

But if I add, "A 10 year longitudinal study at the University of Wisconsin determined that modern running shoes *increase* the incidence rate of injury among runners." Now we've got all three things working in the argument's favor. 


## Arguments in Marketing

Most arguments don't completely work in marketing. I think this is because they take too long. Also, because arguments tend to be too rational. I'm not really convinced that we hairless apes make decisions purely on logic. Here's how I think it works. We make decisions with our emotions (either fear or greed) and then we run those decisions through the filter of logic to see if it checks out. 

So what you want is an argument that is true as soon as somebody hears it. An old-time ad guy once called this "the leap from logic to magic." Avis rent-a-car's original campaign is a great example of this. DBB presented campaign after campaign, which Avis killed. Finally the client said, "You're giving people reasons to use us. I want you to give people a reason to like us."

The result was the ["We Try Harder"](http://sellsellblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/advertising-greatness-2-avis.html
) campaign. The entire campaign is an argument to try Avis that is absolutely true when you hear it. One headline - "Avis needs you. You don't need Avis. Avis never forgets this.""


## How do I overcome writer's block?

>"Writer's block was invented in California by people who don't know how to write." <br>
>-- Terry Pratchett

There is no such thing as writer's block. Writing is process, just like everything else. And if you don't like the output of a process there are only two things that could be wrong.

1. Your inputs are bad
2. Your process is broken

So here are some things to check

#### Do you have enough information?

The quickest way to get stuck is try to write something that you don't fully understand. The faster you need to get things written the more likely this is to happen. The solution for this is either more research/interviewing or a set of brackets. 

Brackets work like this [great example of how brackets work go here.]

What they do is let you keep writing, even if you don't know a part of what you need to finish. Instead of getting derailed, you go back later. This may seem simple, but it is a tremendous trick. Once, I was writing a [very important assignment goes here] and when I got stuck I [need use-of-brackets anecdote here] and [incredibly good thing goes here].

#### Is it important yet?

This is another way of asking if you've started with the right subject. But this way is more emotional. If you are writing something and you haven't found a way to make it interesting or important, it's always going to be a chore to produce. 

Spend a little time trying to find something you care about or believe in inside your subject matter. As H.L. Mencken said, "There are no boring subjects, only boring writers."

#### Are you burnt?

Writing is not merely an intellectual activity. It taxes your emotions. In drug and alcohol recovery programs there is a wonderful tool for identifying emotional strain. H.A.L.T. It stands for hungry, angry, lonely, and tired. If you are any of these things, you're not going to do your best work. You're probably not even going to do good work. If you are just burnt, the only thing is to take a break and come back to it. 

#### Is it time to change your plan?

This happens to me very often with email. I'll write one. Then rewrite it. Then rewrite it. Then rewrite it. And finally realize that email is not a good vehicle for what I am trying to communicate. Time for a change of plan. 

Also, your strategy for writing a document could be the wrong one. Writing a talk for a sales conference comprised of only one-liners from 80's action movies is probably a bad idea. There might not be enough good ones to fill your speech. In fact, there might not even be a single good one. Or you may not have time to do that kind of cliché-filled research. 


## Putting the final touch to any piece? The last 20% always seem to take the longest.

Then don't do it. I'm only half-kidding. But the last 20% gives you the least return on your effort. And, you can write the life out of something by overwriting it. Have something worth writing, write it as clearly as possible and when you've done that, don't write anymore.

The other thing to do is to give it to someone with fresh eyes. Or read it aloud. After 80% of the work, you may be too close to it to see it clearly. If you've got time, put it down for a while. You'll be amazed at what you see with fresh eyes.


## How Do I find the perfect "layperson" analogy to emphasize the point I am trying to make and take the prose out of the technical weeds?

Coming up with the right analogy is the real conceptual work of writing. It can be very hard. But when you get it right, it can be very powerful. A couple of things to try. 

#### Think of a specific layperson

Imagine explaining it to your grandmother or a non-technical friend. Somebody that you have history with, so you can mine those shared experiences for the raw materials of your analogy. 

#### Come up with a lot of them

Babe Ruth only hit a home run 8.4% of the time he was at bat. But everybody knows he set records for hitting home runs. I think even the best writers/creative people have a similar percentage for ideation. 90% of the ideas we have aren't very good. So the only solution is to take a lot of swings. 

If you're really gnawing on a difficult problem, write 10 analogies. Pick the best one and try that. That might sound like a lot of work, but that's how they do it in the big leagues. 


## How do I be more concise and to the point.

First, change the question to "How do I be more concise?"

Second, recognize that we say things like "concise and to the point" or "the fact that" because they lend our speech a rhythm. This rhythm gives us time to think. It gives us time to breathe. But on the screen or page, these extra words just get in the way. 

So, the thing to do is to cut these extra things out and see if you lose any meaning. Almost all adjectives and adverbs can go. Make sure no headers or sentences repeat meaning. Make a copy of something you've written and just start hacking away. In a strange way, it's kind of fun. 



### How can I be more creative?

The question is really how do I have better ideas. This is a very broad subject. It helps to be smart. It helps to have a lot of general knowledge. But it helps even more to *work* at it. 

Accept, for a moment, that the quality of ideas you generate will follow the normal distribution of statistics. When you come up with a bunch of ideas, most of them are mediocre. A very few of them are wildly bad and a very few of them are very good. So rather than worrying about the quality of any one idea, the thing to do is to come up with a bunch of ideas and kill all the one's that aren't very good. Make a herd and then cull it. 

The act of pushing through the feeling that you don't have any more ideas causes you to deepen the understanding of the problem you are trying to solve. That in turn causes you to be more likely to come up with a better solution. A few iterations of this and you get to some good ideas.

If you are working with a difficult problem, make it physical. Write your ideas on slips of paper and put them on the wall. Seems stupid, but it works. And at the very least it helps with the feeling of "I'm not getting anywhere/I don't know what I'm doing" that accompanies every creative process. 


## I'd like a copyeditor to ensure that what is written is grammatically correct.

Me too. In fact, that's the best way. Anything very important should be proofed. But for most of the things we write. Nobody is going to notice our use of grammar as long as we have a point and get to it quickly.

In fact, the way most people recognize bad grammar in a business setting is that they get upset when they read a piece of writing because it is wasting their time. Then they go looking for grammatical errors, to hold up as reasons why the writing sucks. (As if wasting the reader's time wasn't sin enough?) The point is, if you don't waste people's time, then they'll never start shooting at your prose. 

I certainly don't sweat grammar in emails. Do you?


### I worry about proper punctuation.

Only use commas, periods and quotation marks. Of course, you will break this rule, but try not to and you will get into the least amount of trouble possible. 

* A period can go at the end of anything. Seriously.
* Commas do not indicate a pause in speaking
* Commas should be used before conjunctions (and, or, but)
* Commas, *a punctuation mark much beloved*, can be used to indicate a phrase in apposition. Like that one in italics. [good explanation here](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/where-do-i-use-commas?page=all)


### How do I use structure as a guide for effective writing?

The best way to figure out structure is to take a few good examples of the kind of thing you want to write and outline them. This forces you to slow down, and is, in itself, a kind of deep reading. Once you see how those pieces work, you'll naturally combine elements to create something that works well for you. 

It may also help to point out that there are five basic kinds of writing.

## The five fundamental forms of writing

1. Story
2. Argument
3. Instructions
4. Dialog
5. Summary

I believe these structures are atomic. Everything ever written is composed of at least one of these forms. Sure, there are other things going on inside them, but it is like the difference between the visible and the quantum weirdness. 

For example, if I wanted to convince you that physical fitness was important, I could *summarize* the risks of obesity. Then I could *instruct* you to calculate your BMI and, if necessary, to seek help. 

Or I could tell you the *story* of Ralph, a guy who hasn't gotten off the couch since he left High School. Ralph wanted to go out to get the mail. But when he tried, he had a heart attack. After a stay in the hospital, he pulled his life together and lost 150 pounds. Then I could *argue* that Ralph would have been better off if he had just gone for an occasional walk. Then I could *instruct* you not to be a "Ralph."

These forms can be combined in almost endless ways. I could argue that you shouldn't lie. Or I could use the story of "The Boy Who Cried Wolf," as my argument. 

After you understand how other writers effectively structure their writing you will find the way that is most natural and productive for you.
