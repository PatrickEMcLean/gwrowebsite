# About the Method

**good words** (right order) is a non-grammar based heuristic that helps professionals produce clear, crisp writing with less effort. Rather than focusing on what happens on the page, the method begins with what is happening in the writer's mind. After all, clear writing is little more than clear thinking. 

It's not that grammar isn't important. It's that a writer can follow the "rules"[^rules] of grammar and usage *and still write very badly.* At their best, grammar and usage are an aid to clarity and efficiency. By emphasizing efficiency and logical clarity, we find that most grammatical problems disappear without struggle or shame.

[^rules]: The "rules" of grammar are often confusing and contradictory. Nearly all of the "advice to writers" that you've been bludgeoned with was developed for a time before the Internet. If you want to be *right* you have to choose a *right*. But which one? American English, British English, Indian English, Australian English, Singaporean English -- AP Style vs. Chicago? Any of the many standards you could pick are right. And all of them are different. That way lies madness. As communicators our only salvation is to be found in clarity.
